## General info
My first Javascript - React web development project. The purpose of this project was to learn how to create and use React's framework to make a functional website. This website uses an API called Robohash for the robot images, and fetches JSON to structure the robot names and emails.The website is deployed through Github Pages.

## Technologies
* React.js - version 16.10.2
* Tachyons - version 4.11.1
* JSON
